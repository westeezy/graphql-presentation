Built with Node 4.0.0, but should work on anything above 0.12 with
harmony.

If using nvm run `nvm install 4.0` followed by `nvm use 4.0`

Then typical node setup task of `npm install` to get deps

* To seed DB run `npm run seed`
* To test run `npm run test`
* To ling run `npm run lint`
* To show CLI example run `npm run client` (modifies DB so reseed after if
doing demos).
* To run browser demo run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:8000`
* To view slides in the slides directory run
`npm install` followed by `grunt` and navigate to `localhost:9000`.
